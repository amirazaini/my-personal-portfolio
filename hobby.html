<center><h3>My hobby is make up..Why i loved make up because makeup is one of those things that you get better with as time goes by. Also, there's always something new on the market so it never gets old or boring and whether it's a sassy liner, bold lipstick or face paint, makeup is one of the best ways to express myself. There are no rules to makeup, so im free to do what I want with it and just be me.. </h3><center>
<center><h3>As I said, there are no rules to makeup and you're free to wear none at all or go all out and wear a full face of makeup. If anyone says otherwise, they can Bibbidy-Bobbibi-Boo themselves out of your face because you don't need that type of negativity in your life.</h3></center>
